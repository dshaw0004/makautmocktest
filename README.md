Since I am a MCA(Master of Computer Application) student under MAKAUT ( Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology),
I have developed a simple website to practice for the CA4 exams.

I have build the first version this website just 2 days before my 2nd semester CA4 exam,
so initially it only contains the questions from 2nd semester and only those subjects that I have.
