Since I am a MCA(Master of Computer Application) student under MAKAUT ( Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology),
I have developed a simple website to practice for the MCQ based exams.

I have build the first version this website just 2 days before my 2nd semester CA4 exam,
so initially it only contains the questions from 2nd semester and only those subjects that I have, i.e., Data Structure with python, operating system, OOPs with Java, Networking, and Cyber Security.

## Tools

- Shadcn UI, for UI components
- https://uiverse.io/loaders, for typewriter animation
- Google Gemini API for generating question sets.
- [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/projects/5993827729178666057?pli=1) by Google is used to generate the ui design which is saved in the `/ui-design` directory.

## Issues

- only provides 5 subjects of MCA 2nd semester

## Future Planning

I am planning to implement following things in this app:

- Log in/Sign up page for better security
- storing id of all question sets attended by the student so that we can serve unattended set from the stored sets.

### For UI

- planning to add [SmoothUI](https://www.smoothui.dev/) for animated Shadcn components.
- showing warning if user tries to cheat during test.

### For Backend

- storing all question set generated by ai in database.

## Version

v0.0.2-Dev
